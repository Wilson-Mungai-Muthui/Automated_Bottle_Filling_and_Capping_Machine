# Automated_Bottle_Filling_and_Capping_Machine
Automation, including the use of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), can improve production rates and reduce costs in industries such as pharmaceuticals, oil, and beverages, where bottle filling and capping processes are essential. However, the high cost of PLCs can deter small businesses from adopting this technology. In this research, an alternative system using an Arduino microcontroller is proposed for bottle filling and capping. The system includes user-defined volume selection and remote monitoring capabilities, and is intended to be more affordable and accessible than PLC-based systems. The system is tested and the results show that it is able to accurately fill bottles and cap them simultaneously, achieving the desired goals of the research. The use of the Arduino microcontroller allows for cost reductions and greater accessibility compared to traditional PLCs, making it a useful tool for small businesses or those looking to automate their bottle filling and capping processes.
